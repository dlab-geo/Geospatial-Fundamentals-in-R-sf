    "\n",
    "[`sf`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) is a relatively new package that makes it easier to work with geospatial data in R. In the last few years it has grown more powerful and stable. This is really great because the previous means of working with geospatial data in R (the `sp` package) was more complicated. `sf` is now the go-to package for working with `vector` geospatial data in R. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Protip**: If you work with `raster` data you will want to checkout the [raster](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster/index.html) package. We will not cover raster data in this tutorial.\n",

    "### `sf` = <u>s</u>imple <u>f</u>eatures\n",
    "`sf` creates geospatial `data.frame`s that retain all of the functionality of R `data.frame`s, but which are extended with a geometry column and with geospatial metadata, making it easy to process your data using both standard table-based operations and explicitly geospatial operations.\n",
