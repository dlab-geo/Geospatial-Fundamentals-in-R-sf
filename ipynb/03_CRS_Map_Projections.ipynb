    "<br><br>As a refresher, a CRS describes how the coordinates in a geospatial dataset relate to locations on the surface of the earth. \n",
    "\n",
    "A `geographic CRS` consists of: \n",
    "- a 3D model of the shape of the earth (a **datum**), approximated as a sphere or spheroid (aka ellipsoid)\n",
    "- the **units** of the coordinate system (e.g, decimal degrees, meters, feet) and \n",
    "- the **origin** (i.e. the 0,0 location), specified as the meeting of the **equator** and the **prime meridian** \n",

    "#### There are many, many CRSs\n",

    "- You need to know the data about your data (or `metadata`) to use it appropriately.\n",

    "- Some analysis methods expect geospatial data to be in a projected CRS\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some R packages, but not all, implement dynamic reprojection from the input CRS to the required CRS and assume a specific CRS (WGS84) when a CRS is not explicitly defined.\n",

    "\n",
    "- What CRSs used in your study area and their main characteristics\n",
    "- How to identify, or `get`, the CRS of a geodataframe\n",
    "- How to `set` the CRS of geodataframe (i.e. define the projection)\n",
